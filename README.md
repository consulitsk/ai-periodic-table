# 🧪 Interactive Periodic Table (LLM Experiment)

This project is the result of an experiment focused on generating a complete interactive web page **entirely using a generative LLM agent (ChatGPT)** – without manual programming.

The goal was to verify how much of a modern UI application can be generated by simply describing the desired behavior, including:

- page layout and structure (HTML, JS, CSS)
- data logic and rendering
- UI styling (TailwindCSS)
- interactivity (React, JSX)
- 3D visualizations (model-viewer)

---

## 🔍 Features

- **Full periodic table** with data loaded from a JSON source.
- **Category color highlighting** using a dedicated color palette.
- **Element details** including:
  - name, symbol, atomic number
  - weight, phase, and category
  - summary, discoverer, and electron configuration
  - Bohr model image
  - **3D atom model** via `<model-viewer>`
- **No build tools needed** – works as a pure `.html` file.

## 📦 Technologies Used

| Technology        | Purpose                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| React (UMD)       | Interactivity (no bundler required)         |
| TailwindCSS       | Utility-first styling framework             |
| Babel Standalone  | Transpiling JSX in the browser              |
| model-viewer      | Displaying 3D atomic models                 |
| PeriodicTableJSON | Data source for chemical elements           |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the [`index.html`](./index.html) file in your browser.
3. That’s it – the page is fully functional without any build process.

## 🧠 Motivation

This project was created to demonstrate the capabilities of modern **LLM tools** for automating the generation of UI components, data visualization, and logic – without writing code manually. It uses open datasets and web technologies rendered entirely in the browser.
